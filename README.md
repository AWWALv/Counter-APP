# Counter-APP
This was created as my first javascript project to help in counting and storing numbers of people in a particular environment.
## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size


### Useful resources

- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) - This helped me in understanding most of the javascript concepts. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Scrimba](https://www.scrimba.com) - This is an amazing site in which their tutorial video  helped me finally understand how to do this. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
